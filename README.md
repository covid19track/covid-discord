## Downloading
To begin, just open a terminal and type in:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pasenidis/covid-discord.git
cd covid-discord
code .
# or
atom .
# or just use your favorite IDE!
```
Also create a credentials.txt with your token inside, that's safer than having it in bot.py in case you upload it online.

## FAQ
* Q: Why do I have the token in a seperate file?
* A: Safety, for better open-sourcing. It takes time to have two seperate git repositories, one with a token and a second without a token. I just add credentials.txt to .gitignore and upload all the code to GitHub.
* Q: How can I contribute?
* A: There are two ways of contributing: you can either fork the repository (which won't really help because that will not be the original project) or just contribute to my own code! How? Just commit, you can even do this online! If your improvement/change/contribution seems right to the maintainer, he approves it and the project becomes a bit better, because of you! <3
* Q: Can I join your server?
